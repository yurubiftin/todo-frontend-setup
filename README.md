# Todo App
This is a simple todo app built with React . It allows users to create, view, update, and delete their todos. The app uses a REST API to communicate between the client and server.

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, clone this repository and navigate to the client directory:
`git clone `
`cd `

Then install the required dependencies:
    `npm install`
Next, start the development server:
    `npm start`
This will start the React app on `http://localhost:3000`
